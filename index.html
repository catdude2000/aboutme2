                <h3>Biography</h3>
                I was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 1990.  I've spent most of my life living
                on the South East side of the city.  In school growing up I played the saxaphone,
                ran hurdle events in track, and participated in show choir.
                After high school I briefly attended Iowa State University.
                I also have taken some classes at Kirkwood.  My jobs have mostly been in food and 
                customer service.  I'm hoping this class will allow me to get a job that
                I like and that will allow me to have the life I want.
