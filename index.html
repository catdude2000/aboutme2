        <h3>Biography</h3>
        I was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa in 1990.  I've spent most of my life living
        on the South East side of the city.  In school growing up I played the saxaphone,
        ran hurdle events in track, and participated in show choir.
        After high school I briefly attended Iowa State University.
        I also have taken some classes at Kirkwood.  My jobs have mostly been in food and 
        customer service.  I'm hoping this class will allow me to get a job that
        I like and that will allow me to have the life I want.
