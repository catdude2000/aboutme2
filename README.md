## About Me, Again

This is an evolving site, built for a project in DeltaV's code 201 class.  Currently It will ask the user their name, and then five questions about the developer of this site.  Then after all the questions are answered, it will make one last statement to the user, using their name.  The main site after the prompts includes a biography and work history of the author.
